- tried, tested, stable, performs, and widely supported

**(Extended) File Allocation Table** : *FAT, FAT32, exFAT*

- Traditional filesystem for Windows

**New Technology File System** : *ntfs*

**B-tree file system** : *btrfs*

A computer storage format that combines a file system based on the copy-on-write (COW) principle with a logical volume manager (distinct from Linux's LVM), developed together. Btrfs is intended to address the lack of pooling, snapshots, checksums, and integral multi-device spanning in Linux file systems.
